# Introduction

As far as CSS is concerned, every element on a webpage is a rectangular box. You can see this by opening the developer tools, going to the inspector tab, then the styles tab, and adding `border: 1px solid red;` to `*` (the CSS selector that means all elements).

## The Box Model

Every box has certain essential properties:

### Width and Height

At the centre of each box is the content box, where the contents of the box are displayed (for example, text or other, nested, elements). The element's width and height properties set the width and height of the content box.

### Padding

Padding is the space on the inside of the element between the content and the element's border. The padding on all four sides of the box can be set at once using the `padding` property or it can be set on each side individually using `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`.
